  {
    t:"What crypto trading actually is", d:"10 min", lvl:1,
    concept:`<p><b>Trading</b> means buying an asset hoping to sell it later at a higher price (or selling first if you expect a drop). <b>Investing</b> is buying to hold for years; <b>trading</b> is shorter-term and more active.</p>
    <p>Crypto trades 24/7, 365 days a year — there is no closing bell. Prices are set by supply and demand on <b>exchanges</b>, matched through an <b>order book</b>. The two core activities you'll learn:</p>
    <ul><li><b>Spot trading</b> — you own the actual coin (covered in this track).</li>
    <li><b>Derivatives / futures</b> — you trade a contract on the price, often with leverage (Track 3).</li></ul>
    <p>Most beginners blow up accounts by jumping straight to leverage. We start with spot for a reason.</p>`,
    example:`<p>You buy 0.01 BTC at $60,000 (costing $600). A week later BTC is $66,000, so your 0.01 BTC is worth $660. You sell and realize a <code>+$60</code> profit (+10%). If instead BTC fell to $54,000, your stake is worth $540 — a <code>-$60</code> loss. That's spot: simple ownership, gains and losses move 1:1 with price.</p>`,
    exercise:`<p>Open a price chart for Bitcoin (e.g. on a free site like TradingView or CoinGecko). Note the price now. Imagine buying $100 worth. Calculate what your $100 would be worth if the price rose 8% — and if it fell 8%. Get comfortable thinking in both directions.</p>`,
    quiz:{q:"In spot trading, if the price of a coin you own falls 10%, your position value...", a:["Falls 10%","Falls more than 10% because of leverage","Is protected by the exchange","Stays the same until you sell"], correct:0,
    fb:"Spot moves 1:1 with price — no leverage amplifies it. The loss is real once you're in the position, whether or not you've sold."}
  },
  {
    t:"Wallets: custodial vs self-custody", d:"12 min", lvl:1,
    concept:`<p>A <b>wallet</b> stores the keys that control your crypto. Two kinds:</p>
    <ul><li><b>Custodial</b> — an exchange (Coinbase, Binance, Kraken) holds the keys for you. Easy, but "not your keys, not your coins." If the exchange fails or freezes your account, you're exposed.</li>
    <li><b>Self-custody</b> — you hold the keys yourself (software wallets like MetaMask, or hardware wallets like Ledger/Trezor). Full control, full responsibility.</li></ul>
    <p>Your <b>seed phrase</b> (12–24 words) <em>is</em> your wallet. Anyone with it owns your funds. Never type it into a website, never store it in a photo or cloud note.</p>`,
    example:`<p>A trader keeps a small "hot" balance on an exchange for active trading, and moves long-term holdings to a hardware wallet kept offline. When the exchange later pauses withdrawals during volatility, only the small active balance is affected — the bulk is safe in self-custody.</p>`,
    exercise:`<p>Write down (on paper) the difference between a <b>public address</b> (safe to share, like an email) and a <b>private key / seed phrase</b> (secret, like a password). If you have a wallet, locate where your address is shown — but do NOT view or screenshot your seed phrase on a connected device.</p>`,
    quiz:{q:"Which of these is safe to share publicly?", a:["Your seed phrase","Your private key","Your public wallet address","Your exchange password"], correct:2,
    fb:"Your public address is like an email — people use it to send you funds. The seed phrase, private key and password must stay secret."}
  },
  {
    t:"Centralized vs decentralized exchanges", d:"11 min", lvl:1,
    concept:`<p><b>CEX (centralized exchange)</b> — e.g. Coinbase, Binance, Kraken. A company runs the order book, holds your funds, and requires identity verification (KYC). Deep liquidity, easy fiat on-ramps, beginner-friendly.</p>
    <p><b>DEX (decentralized exchange)</b> — e.g. Uniswap. Trades happen directly from your self-custody wallet via smart contracts. No sign-up, no KYC, but you pay network "gas" fees and face risks like scam tokens and front-running.</p>
    <p>Beginners almost always start on a reputable CEX. DEXes matter once you trade newer tokens not listed on big exchanges.</p>`,
    example:`<p>To buy ETH with a debit card, you'd use a CEX — it converts your dollars and you trade instantly. To swap that ETH for a brand-new token only available on-chain, you'd connect MetaMask to a DEX like Uniswap and approve the swap, paying a gas fee to the network.</p>`,
    exercise:`<p>List three things you'd want to check before trusting a CEX with your money: e.g. regulatory standing in your country, security/insurance track record, withdrawal reliability, and fees. Research one exchange against this checklist.</p>`,
    quiz:{q:"A key difference of a DEX vs a CEX is that on a DEX...", a:["You must complete KYC identity checks","Funds trade directly from your own wallet","A company holds your coins","There are never any fees"], correct:1,
    fb:"On a DEX you keep custody — trades execute from your wallet via smart contracts. You still pay network gas fees."}

  {
    t:"Order types: market, limit & stop", d:"13 min", lvl:1,
    concept:`<p>Three orders cover most of what you'll do:</p>
    <ul><li><b>Market order</b> — buy/sell immediately at the best available price. Fast, but you accept whatever price you get (slippage).</li>
    <li><b>Limit order</b> — buy/sell only at a price you set or better. You control price, but it may never fill.</li>
    <li><b>Stop order</b> — triggers a market/limit order once price hits a level. Used for <b>stop-losses</b> (cap a loss) and breakout entries.</li></ul>
    <p>Rule of thumb: use <b>limit</b> orders to enter calmly, <b>market</b> orders when you must act now, and always pair positions with a <b>stop</b>.</p>`,
    example:`<p>BTC is $60,000. You think it's overpriced short-term and want in at $58,000 — you place a <b>limit buy</b> at $58,000. It fills only if price drops there. After buying, you place a <b>stop-loss</b> at $56,000: if price falls to $56k, a sell triggers automatically, capping your loss instead of hoping it recovers.</p>`,
    exercise:`<p>On a demo/paper account, place one of each: a limit buy below the current price, and a stop-loss below your entry. Watch how the limit waits to fill and how the stop sits dormant until triggered. (Most exchanges offer a testnet or paper mode.)</p>`,
    quiz:{q:"You want to guarantee you buy right now and don't care about a few dollars of slippage. Use a...", a:["Limit order","Market order","Stop-limit order","Take-profit order"], correct:1,
    fb:"A market order executes immediately at the best available price. A limit order might never fill if price moves away."}
  },
  {
    t:"The order book, spread & slippage", d:"11 min", lvl:2,
    concept:`<p>The <b>order book</b> lists all open buy orders (<b>bids</b>) and sell orders (<b>asks</b>). The highest bid and lowest ask meet in the middle.</p>
    <ul><li><b>Spread</b> = lowest ask − highest bid. A tight spread means a liquid market; a wide spread is costly.</li>
    <li><b>Liquidity / depth</b> = how much volume sits near the current price. Thin books move violently.</li>
    <li><b>Slippage</b> = the difference between the price you expected and the price you actually got, common with large market orders in thin markets.</li></ul>`,
    example:`<p>Best bid $100.00, best ask $100.10 → spread is $0.10. You market-buy a large amount: the first units fill at $100.10, but you eat through the book up to $100.40 to complete the order. Your average fill is $100.22 — the $0.12 above the ask is slippage.</p>`,
    exercise:`<p>Open the order book for a major pair (BTC/USDT) and a tiny low-volume altcoin. Compare the spreads. Notice how much thinner the altcoin's depth is — that's why small coins are riskier to trade in size.</p>`,
    quiz:{q:"Slippage is most likely to hurt you when you...", a:["Place a small limit order in a deep market","Place a large market order in a thin market","Use a stop-loss","Trade a major pair like BTC/USDT"], correct:1,
    fb:"Large market orders in illiquid (thin) markets walk up the order book, filling at progressively worse prices."}
  },
  {
    t:"Fees: makers, takers & the hidden costs", d:"10 min", lvl:2,
    concept:`<p>Every trade has costs that quietly eat returns:</p>
    <ul><li><b>Taker fee</b> — you remove liquidity (market order). Usually higher.</li>
    <li><b>Maker fee</b> — you add liquidity (resting limit order). Usually lower, sometimes a rebate.</li>
    <li><b>Spread</b> — an implicit cost on every round trip.</li>
    <li><b>Withdrawal / network fees</b> — for moving coins off the exchange.</li></ul>
    <p>For active traders, fees compound fast. A 0.1% fee each way is 0.2% per round trip — trade 100 times and that's ~20% of capital churned in fees alone.</p>`,
    example:`<p>You trade $1,000 with a 0.1% taker fee. Entry costs $1, exit costs $1 → $2 per round trip. That means the price must move at least 0.2% just for you to break even before any profit. Using limit (maker) orders at 0.04% would cut that to $0.80.</p>`,
    exercise:`<p>Find your exchange's fee schedule. Calculate the round-trip cost on a $500 trade as both a taker and a maker. Decide which order type you'll default to and why.</p>`,
    quiz:{q:"Which usually carries the LOWER fee?", a:["Market (taker) order","Limit (maker) order","Both are always identical","Stop orders are free"], correct:1,
    fb:"Maker orders add liquidity to the book and are typically cheaper, sometimes earning a rebate. Takers pay more for instant execution."}
  },
  {
    t:"Stablecoins & trading pairs", d:"10 min", lvl:1,
    concept:`<p>A <b>stablecoin</b> (USDT, USDC, DAI) is a crypto pegged ~1:1 to a fiat currency, usually the US dollar. They let you "sit in cash" on-chain without converting back to your bank.</p>
    <p>A <b>trading pair</b> is what you trade against what, e.g. <code>BTC/USDT</code> = price of BTC in USDT. The second symbol is the <b>quote</b> currency. Pairs like <code>ETH/BTC</code> price ETH in bitcoin terms.</p>
    <p>Beginners should stick to deep stablecoin pairs (BTC/USDT, ETH/USDC). Note: not all stablecoins are equally safe — some have de-pegged historically.</p>`,
    example:`<p>You sell BTC for USDT near a top to "lock in" dollars without leaving the exchange. When price dips, you redeploy that USDT into BTC again. You never touched your bank, yet you effectively moved to cash and back.</p>`,
    exercise:`<p>On your exchange, find three pairs for ETH (e.g. ETH/USDT, ETH/USDC, ETH/BTC). Note how the quoted price changes depending on the quote currency. Identify which has the most volume.</p>`,
    quiz:{q:"In the pair BTC/USDT, the price tells you...", a:["How many BTC one USDT buys","The price of BTC denominated in USDT","The fee for trading","The leverage applied"], correct:1,
    fb:"The first symbol is the base, the second is the quote. BTC/USDT = the value of one BTC expressed in USDT."}
  },
  {
    t:"Dollar-cost averaging (DCA)", d:"9 min", lvl:1,
    concept:`<p><b>Dollar-cost averaging</b> means buying a fixed dollar amount at regular intervals (e.g. $100 every week) regardless of price, instead of trying to time a single "perfect" entry. It doesn't require charts, indicators, or predicting anything — it's the lowest-effort way to build a long-term position in an asset you believe in.</p>
    <p>DCA smooths your <b>average cost basis</b>: you naturally buy more units when price is low and fewer when it's high. It won't beat a perfect lump-sum entry at the exact bottom, but it removes the risk of dumping all your capital in right before a drop — which is the far more common outcome for beginners guessing tops and bottoms.</p>`,
    example:`<p>You invest $100/week into BTC for 4 weeks at prices $60,000, $50,000, $55,000, and $45,000. You buy 0.00167, 0.002, 0.00182, and 0.00222 BTC each week — 0.00771 BTC total for $400 spent. Your average cost is $400 ÷ 0.00771 ≈ $51,880 per BTC — better than three of the four individual prices, because you automatically bought more when it was cheap.</p>`,
    exercise:`<p>Look up an asset's closing price on the same day for each of the last 4 weeks. Simulate investing a fixed $50/week. Compute how many units you'd own and your average cost basis. Compare it to just buying everything on week 1.</p>`,
    quiz:{q:"The main benefit of DCA over a single lump-sum buy is that it...", a:["Guarantees a higher return every time","Removes the need to time entries and buys more units when price is low","Eliminates all risk of loss","Only works with stablecoins"], correct:1,
    fb:"DCA doesn't guarantee a better outcome than a lucky lump-sum entry, but it removes timing risk and automatically buys more when price dips."}

  {
    t:"Security: protecting funds & spotting scams", d:"12 min", lvl:1,
    concept:`<p>In crypto, you are your own bank — and the target of constant scams. Core defenses:</p>
    <ul><li>Enable <b>2FA</b> with an authenticator app (not SMS, which can be SIM-swapped).</li>
    <li>Use a <b>hardware wallet</b> for serious holdings.</li>
    <li>Never share your <b>seed phrase</b> — no legitimate support will ever ask for it.</li>
    <li>Bookmark exchange URLs to avoid <b>phishing</b> clones.</li>
    <li>Be skeptical of "guaranteed returns," giveaways, "double your crypto," and DMs from "support."</li></ul>`,
    example:`<p>A trader gets a DM: "We noticed suspicious activity — verify your wallet here." The link looks almost like the real exchange. Connecting and signing would drain the wallet. Because they bookmarked the real site and know support never DMs first, they ignore it. That habit saved their funds.</p>`,
    exercise:`<p>Audit your own setup: Is 2FA on an authenticator app enabled? Is your seed phrase stored offline only? Are exchange sites bookmarked? Fix any gap before trading real money.</p>`,
    quiz:{q:"A 'support agent' DMs you asking for your seed phrase to fix an issue. You should...", a:["Share it — they need it to help","Share only half of it","Never share it; it's always a scam","Share it but change it after"], correct:2,

    <li><b>Colour</b> — green/white = closed higher; red/black = closed lower.</li></ul>
    <p>A long body shows strong momentum; long wicks show rejection (price pushed there but got rejected). Candlesticks are the alphabet of charts — every pattern is built from them.</p>`,
    example:`<p>A candle opens at $100, spikes to $108, drops to $99, and closes at $101. The body spans $100→$101 (green), the upper wick reaches $108 (buyers tried higher but got rejected), the lower wick reaches $99. The long upper wick warns that sellers defended $108.</p>`,
    exercise:`<p>Pick a 1-hour chart. Find one candle with a long upper wick and one with a long lower wick. For each, say out loud what happened: who pushed price, and who won by the close.</p>`,

    <p><b>Multi-timeframe analysis:</b> decide direction on a higher timeframe, then zoom in to execute. Trading against the higher-timeframe trend is how beginners get chopped up.</p>`,
    example:`<p>On the daily chart BTC is in a clear uptrend. You drop to the 1-hour to find a pullback to support, then enter long in the direction of the daily trend. The higher timeframe gives the bias; the lower timeframe gives the entry.</p>`,

    concept:`<p>An honest baseline the hype skips: <b>most retail traders lose money</b>, especially with leverage. Profitable trading is a skill that takes <b>months to years</b>, not a weekend. There are no signal groups, gurus, or bots that reliably print money — if it sounds guaranteed, it's a scam. Your early goal is not profit; it's <b>survival and process</b>: protect capital, follow rules, and improve. Expecting realistic outcomes is itself an edge, because it keeps you from over-betting.</p>`,
    example:`<p>Two beginners start with $1,000. One expects to "turn it into $10k fast," over-leverages, and is wiped out in a month. The other treats year one as paid tuition, risks 1%, journals everything, and is still trading — and learning — twelve months later. Only one has a future in this.</p>`,
    exercise:`<p>Write down your honest reason for trading and a realistic 12-month goal framed around <em>process</em> (e.g. "follow my plan on 100 trades," not "make $X"). Revisit it whenever you feel FOMO.</p>`,

Graduation criteria: you follow your rules without deviation, your sample shows positive expectancy, and you've survived a losing streak without tilting. Then start live with the <em>smallest</em> size and scale only as results justify it.</p>`,
    example:`<p>A trader paper-trades the trend-pullback playbook for 60 trades, hits +0.3R expectancy while actually following the rules, then goes live risking 0.5% — tiny size — for another 30 trades before stepping up. No leap straight to big real-money bets.</p>`,
