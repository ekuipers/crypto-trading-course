# Memory / Changelog

Running log of changes to the Crypto Trading Micro-Learning course, per the workflow rules in `CLAUDE.md`.

Note: `CLAUDE.md` referenced a prior `v1.35.1` bug-fix entry, but this file was found empty at the
start of this session (2026-07-18) — no earlier history survived. Versioning restarts here at
v1.36.0 and this file is now the source of truth going forward.

## 2026-07-19 — Workflow rules deduped against CryptoPro Suite's master list (no version bump — docs only)

**Change:** CryptoPro Suite roadmap item — "Add the Workflow rules from project CryptoPro Suite as reference
to the sub-project's workflow rules. Remove every duplicate workflow rule from the sub-projects." `CLAUDE.md`'s
numbered rules 1–5, 7–14 were near-verbatim duplicates of Suite `CLAUDE.md` rules 1, 2, 15, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10,
11, 12, 13, 14 (memory.md changelog discipline, local-node-server-for-testing-only, move-completed-items-to-
memory, auto-commit/sync, update-documentation, roadmap-scan-triggers-implementation, allow-all-edits, JS file
placement, favicon-as-logo, compact-command, skills directory, HTML-in-/docs, title-in-description). Replaced
with a pointer to Suite's `CLAUDE.md` on GitHub; kept only rule 6 ("Update version number in the footer with
the latest version in the change log"), which has no Suite equivalent.
**Verified:** no site code touched — `CLAUDE.md` diff only; `## Roadmap`/`## Bugs` sections unaffected.

## v1.41.1 — 2026-07-18 — Cross-suite title-bar/footer branding consistency

**Driven by:** a CryptoPro Suite workflow-rules audit (rules 7 + 17: consistent title-bar/footer
design, favicon-as-logo at a consistent size, same font, across all sub-projects).

### Changes

- The `.brand` eyebrow label inside the hero banner read "Crypto Academy" instead of "CryptoPro
  Training" — a naming inconsistency versus the page's own `<title>`, the `.page-title` `<h1>` (added
  in v1.41.0), and every other sub-project's header/logo text. Fixed to "CryptoPro Training".
- `.brand` favicon icon bumped 20px → 22px with `border-radius:6px` added, matching the icon
  treatment now used in CryptoPro Suite's and CryptoPro Trader's headers.
- Footer previously had no favicon logo and no creator credit (rule 3/10 gap). Added a 16px favicon
  icon and a "Created by Erik Kuipers ·" line before the version span.
- Left the overall page structure untouched: this is a hero/marketing-style course landing page (large
  `.page-title` heading + decorative banner), not a slim persistent utility header bar like the other
  three sub-projects, and the multi-line footer (module stats + risk disclaimer + version) can't be
  collapsed to a single-line height without cutting the risk warning. Forcing pixel-identical bar
  heights here would mean gutting a working, appropriate design for this page's genre — left as a
  documented, intentional exception rather than attempted.
- Font-family was already the canonical stack shared by every sub-project
  (`-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif`) — no change
  needed.
- `COURSE_VERSION` bumped 1.41.0 → 1.41.1.

**Verified:** grep-confirmed no remaining "Crypto Academy" references in the live HTML/JS (only this
changelog's historical entries below still mention it, left as-is since it's a record of past state).

## v1.41.0 — 2026-07-18 — Site title moved out of the banner

**Roadmap item implemented:** "The Title of the web app sits still in the banner. Move it to the top
left of the page." (Follow-up to v1.39.0: the title text/size was fixed, but it was still living
inside `<header class="top">` — the decorative banner element — not actually outside/above it.)

### Changes

- Added `.page-title`, a new element rendered as the **first child of `<body>`**, before
  `<header class="top">` entirely, so the title now sits on the plain page background rather than
  the banner gradient/art. Moved the `<h1>CryptoPro <span>Training</span></h1>` markup there from
  inside `.banner-inner > .banner-text`.
- Moved the corresponding CSS (`font-size:2.9rem`, the gradient `span`, and the 720px mobile
  fallback) from `header.top h1` to `.page-title h1` / `.page-title` selectors.
- The banner itself keeps its small "🪙 Crypto Academy" brand kicker, the descriptive tagline
  paragraph, and the stats row — just without the big duplicate title.
- Version bump: `COURSE_VERSION` 1.40.0 → 1.41.0.

### Verification

- `node --check` on the extracted `<script>` block — syntax OK.
- Loaded the actual rendered file with `jsdom` (`runScripts:'dangerously'`) and asserted:
  `.page-title` exists and is `document.body.firstElementChild`; `header.top` does **not** contain it
  (`header.contains(pageTitle) === false`) and no longer contains any `<h1>`; `.page-title` precedes
  `header.top` in document order; the h1's computed font-size is `2.9rem` and text reads
  "CryptoPro Training"; `document.title` unchanged; module/track counts unchanged (67/9) confirming
  no regression elsewhere on the page.

## v1.40.0 — 2026-07-18 — All-levels filter + theme bar as top row

**Roadmap items implemented:**
3. "Add the option to select all module of all levels in the module filter section."
4. "Move the theme bar to the top row of the web app."

### Changes

- **New "🔷 All levels" button** in the level picker (`setLevel('all')`). `currentLevel` can now hold
  the sentinel string `'all'` alongside the existing numeric 1/2/3. Every place that branched on
  `currentLevel` was updated to special-case it: `applyLevel()`'s module-visibility check, the active-button
  highlighting (switched from numeric `+b.dataset.l===currentLevel` to `b.dataset.l===String(currentLevel)`
  so it works for both numbers and the `'all'` string), `applyState()`'s progress-bar denominator, and the
  initial load from `localStorage` (previously `+(localStorage.getItem(LKEY))||1` would have silently
  coerced a saved `'all'` back to `1` via `NaN||1` — fixed to check for the string first).
- **Theme bar moved to the top row.** `.topbar` (theme picker) now renders before `.quizbar` (quiz score,
  added in v1.38.0) in the header markup, so it's the first strip visitors see, above the quiz score bar.
- Added `LEVEL_NAMES.all` / `LEVEL_DESC.all` for the picker's label and description text.
- Version bump: `COURSE_VERSION` 1.39.0 → 1.40.0.

### Note on v1.39.0 (site title + track collapse)

Two more roadmap items — "put the site title top-left at 2x size" (using `CryptoPro Training`, the
`Title:` field from `CLAUDE.md`'s own description, per workflow rule #14) and "add the option to
collapse tracks the same way modules collapse" — were implemented in this same working tree but ended
up bundled into a separate concurrent commit (`ecd7c08`, "replace Bitcoin badge with graduation cap")
whose own changelog entry only covers the favicon. Recording what that commit's diff actually contains,
for the record: `<title>`/`<h1>` changed to "CryptoPro Training" (h1 font-size 1.45rem → 2.9rem, with a
1.9rem mobile fallback under 720px), footer branding updated to match, and each track's `<h2>` became
clickable (`toggleTrack()`) collapsing a new `.track-body` wrapper around its modules — mirroring the
existing per-module collapse — with a rotating chevron matching the module chevron's visual language.

### Verification

- `node --check` on the extracted `<script>` block — syntax OK.
- Installed `jsdom` in the scratch directory and loaded the **actual rendered file** (not copied logic)
  with `runScripts:'dangerously'`, then drove it through `window.setLevel`/`window.toggleTrack` and read
  back real computed styles and `localStorage`. Confirmed: 67 modules / 9 tracks render; `setLevel(1)`
  shows only lvl 0/1 modules; `setLevel('all')` shows all 67 and marks the "All levels" button active;
  the progress counter denominator matches the total under "all"; `'all'` round-trips through
  `localStorage`; switching back to `setLevel(2)` still correctly filters to lvl 0/2; `toggleTrack()`
  collapses/expands a track with `track-body` computing to `display:none` via the real CSS cascade;
  `.topbar` now precedes `.quizbar` in document order; `document.title` and the `<h1>` both read
  "CryptoPro Training". All assertions passed with no failures logged.

## v1.38.0 — 2026-07-18 — Quiz score mini dashboard

**Roadmap item implemented:** "Add a mini dashboard at the top of the page on top of the banner,
which shows the score of correctly answered and failed questions."

### Changes

- **New `.quizbar`** layered on the banner (same treatment as the existing theme `.topbar`, stacked
  above it) showing live counts: ✅ correct, ❌ incorrect, 🎯 accuracy %, and total answered.
- **Quiz results now persist** in `localStorage` (`cryptoCourseQuizState_v1`, keyed by module id,
  storing `{chosen, correct}` per quiz) instead of only living in the DOM for the current page load.
  `applyQuizState()` restores the correct/wrong highlighting and locks already-answered quizzes on
  every load, and `updateQuizDashboard()` recomputes the bar from that same stored state.
- **`answer()`** now takes the module id, records the first result per quiz (subsequent clicks after
  an answer is locked are ignored, so re-clicking can't inflate the score), and refreshes the bar.
- **`resetProgress()`** now also clears the quiz state and dashboard alongside module completion, since
  "Reset progress" should mean a full reset.
- Version bump: `COURSE_VERSION` 1.37.0 → 1.38.0.

### Verification

- `node --check` on the extracted `<script>` block — syntax OK.
- Copied the exact `loadQuiz`/`saveQuiz`/`updateQuizDashboard`/`applyQuizState`/`answer` function
  bodies into a standalone Node harness with a minimal fake DOM/localStorage and asserted: answering
  one quiz correctly and one incorrectly yields 1/1/50%; re-clicking an already-answered quiz does not
  double-count; a simulated page reload (fresh DOM elements, same stored state) restores the correct
  totals plus the correct/wrong button highlighting and re-locks the quiz; reset zeroes everything.
  All assertions passed. (Full browser install via Playwright was judged disproportionate for this
  static-site change; the harness exercises the real, unmodified function bodies.)

## v1.38.0 — 2026-07-18 — Favicon: Bitcoin badge → graduation cap

**Problem:** The favicon's ₿ badge said "crypto" but nothing said "training app" (user feedback).

**Fix:** Replaced the Bitcoin ₿ badge in `docs/favicon.svg` with a graduation-cap (mortarboard)
badge — same orange (`#f7931a`) circle, cap drawn as dark paths (board, base, tassel) so it stays
crisp at small sizes with no font dependencies. Candlesticks and trend line unchanged.
Re-rendered all rasters (`favicon.ico`, `favicon-32.png`, `favicon-192.png`,
`apple-touch-icon.png`) via cairosvg. Version bump 1.37.0 → 1.38.0.

**Verification:** Rendered at 180px and inspected visually — cap, tassel, and candles all legible.

## v1.37.0 — 2026-07-18 — Site favicon & logo

**Task:** Create a favicon based on the site's theme and use it as the site logo (workflow rule #10).

### Changes

- **`docs/favicon.svg` (new):** hand-built 64×64 SVG icon matching the site theme — dark navy
  gradient rounded square (`#1b2330` → `#0b0e14`, border `#27303f`), three rising candlesticks in
  the site's green/red (`#3fb950`/`#f85149`), a translucent green trend line, and a Bitcoin-orange
  (`#f7931a`) badge with a hand-drawn ₿ path (drawn as strokes, not text, so it renders in any
  rasterizer without font dependencies).
- **`docs/favicon.ico`, `docs/favicon-32.png`, `docs/favicon-192.png`, `docs/apple-touch-icon.png`
  (new):** raster fallbacks rendered from the SVG via cairosvg (ImageMagick's SVG renderer produced
  artifacts; cairosvg output was verified visually).
- **`docs/index.html` + `docs/crypto-trading-course.html`:** added `<link rel="icon">` (SVG + ICO)
  and `<link rel="apple-touch-icon">` tags in `<head>`.
- **`docs/crypto-trading-course.html`:** header brand now uses the favicon as the site logo
  (replaced the 🪙 emoji with an inline `<img src="favicon.svg">`).
- **Version bump:** `COURSE_VERSION` 1.36.0 → 1.37.0 (footer updates automatically).

### Verification

- Rendered the icon at 180px and inspected it visually — candles, trend line, and ₿ badge all crisp.
- Grepped both HTML files to confirm favicon links present and no duplicate tags.

## v1.36.0 — 2026-07-18 — Roadmap rescan: content expansion + bug fixes

**Roadmap item implemented:** "Add more details to the existing modules and add new modules where
you deem necessary."

### New modules added (61 → 67 total, still 9 tracks)

- **Foundations & Spot Trading:** "Dollar-cost averaging (DCA)" — a beginner accumulation concept
  that was a clear gap next to the existing lump-sum/timing content.
- **Technical Analysis:** "Bollinger Bands & volatility" — the course had momentum (RSI, MACD) and
  trend (MAs) indicators but no volatility indicator.
- **Futures & Leverage:** "Hedging with derivatives" — covers using a short perp to offset spot risk
  without selling, a natural advanced-level companion to the existing long/short and sizing modules.
- **Advanced Charting & Market Structure:** "Volume profile & point of control" — institutional-style
  volume-by-price concept (POC, HVN/LVN) that complements the existing liquidity/order-block module.
- **Strategies & Playbooks:** "Playbook 4 — DCA & accumulation" — a non-technical-analysis playbook
  tying the new DCA foundations module into a concrete, rule-based approach.
- **Crypto Market Structure & Sentiment:** "The Fear & Greed Index & social sentiment" — sentiment
  gauge distinct from the existing funding-rate/OI positioning content.

Each new module follows the existing format (concept, worked example, exercise, quiz) and carries an
explicit `lvl` (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced) exactly like every other module.

Added matching glossary terms: Dollar-cost averaging (DCA), Bollinger Bands, Hedging, Volume profile
/ POC, Fear & Greed Index.

### Bugs found and fixed

1. **Stale hardcoded counts.** The banner ("📚 4 tracks · 🔗 33 video-link + reading modules") and
   footer ("4 tracks · 33 modules") were left over from an earlier version of the course and no
   longer matched the actual 9-track/61-module (now 67) content. Fixed by computing both from the
   `COURSE` array at render time (`COURSE.length` / `totalModules`) so they can't go stale again.
2. **Fragile positional level-lookup array.** Levels for the first four tracks (Foundations, TA,
   Futures, Risk & Psychology) were assigned via a flat `LEVELS[]` array indexed by render order,
   while tracks 5–9 already used an explicit `lvl` field per module. Inserting a module anywhere in
   the first four tracks would have silently shifted every subsequent module's level. Refactored so
   every module across all 9 tracks now declares `lvl` explicitly; the positional array was removed.
   *How verified:* extracted the course `<script>` block and ran it under Node (`node --check` for
   syntax, then a `require()`-based structural check) confirming 9 tracks / 67 modules, expected
   level distribution, and no module missing required fields.
3. **No GitHub Pages entry point.** `.github/workflows/static.yml` (added upstream) uploads the
   entire repo as the Pages artifact, but there was no root `index.html` — the course itself lives at
   `docs/crypto-trading-course.html`. Added a root `index.html` that redirects to it.
4. **Missing `trading-journal.xlsx`.** The course's "Trading journal & backtest template" module links
   to `trading-journal.xlsx` (a download in the same folder) and the README describes it in detail,
   but the file didn't exist in the repo. Generated a real workbook (via a one-off Python/openpyxl
   script) with the four tabs the README already documents: Instructions, Trade Log (auto-calculates
   Risk $, P/L $, R-multiple from typed inputs), Dashboard (win rate, expectancy, total R read live
   from the Trade Log), and Backtest (same mechanics for proving a playbook against historical data
   before risking money). Saved to `docs/trading-journal.xlsx` next to the course HTML.
5. **Stray corrupted bytes in `README.md`.** The file ended with a garbled, UTF-16-encoded
   `# cyrpto-trading-course` stub (rendering as spaced-out characters) — leftover junk from repo
   initialization, not real content. Removed it.
6. **No version number surfaced anywhere.** `CLAUDE.md` instructs keeping a version number in the
   footer, but none existed. Added `COURSE_VERSION` in the script and display it in the footer.

### Also updated

- `README.md`: module count 61 → 67.
- `CLAUDE.md`: cleared the Roadmap and Bugs sections now that this pass is complete (per workflow
  rule #3 — completed roadmap items and fixed bugs move here).
